# J's Filename Cleaner
A simple filename cleaner that removes specified words from a collection of files, limited to the filetypes the user inputs. This is a free, open-source software, so please credit me, Jaden Williams, as the developer for any project use. Thank you!

1. Input directory where cleaner reads the files.
2. Input file-type extensions that cleaner will modify. (This is to prevent cleaner from rename unwanted files like .exe's)
3. Input words that are to be removed from filenames. (Ex: cache, temp, fraft, -, 0, 1, 2...)
